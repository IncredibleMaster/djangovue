Generates vue frontend structure for django rest framework projects.

Generates forms(validated with vuelidate) for your serializers and viewsets and methods to call api via vue-resource.

TODO:

- generate forms for your filters.
- work with other generic views, not just viewsets
- error descriptions
- css
- load choices from related fields from api(options call, would require modified drf metadata)
- better demo
